    "In the last practical session, we saw how to run multiple behaviors in parallel on multiple robots. In this section we will see more advanced methods for combining behaviors by modulating their activations according to internal states of the robot and by allowing them to sense the attributes of others. In order to start with a clean basis, let's first provide the definition of several behaviors. These four behaviors are simply implementations of the [Braitenberg vehicles](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s6ibk_ACiJb9CERJ_8L_b4KFu9d04ZG_htUbb_YSYT4/edit#slide=id.g31e1b425a3_0_0) we have seen in class, where the sources (i.e. what is sensed by the proximeters) are other robots:"

You can of course modify the V-REP scene at your will, e.g adding cups or trees. Don't forget to save you modified V-REP scene (`File -> Save scene as` in V-REP). You can start your project in a new Jupyter Notebook (`File -> New notebook -> Python3`) in the menu bar at the top of this notebook). Use both text cells (explaining what you are doing) and code cells (with the corresponding code to execute).\n",
