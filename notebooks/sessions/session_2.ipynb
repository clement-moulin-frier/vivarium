Instead, we *return* the values of the motor activations in the last line and they will be automatically sent to the agent motors when the behavior will be executed. In the last line, the values after the `return` keyword have to be the left and right wheel activation (in this order). Both activations have to be between 0 and 1.

    "Let's now practice a bit. Remember the Braitenberg Vehicle examples we have seen in [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s6ibk_ACiJb9CERJ_8L_b4KFu9d04ZG_htUbb_YSYT4/edit#slide=id.g31e1b425a3_0_0). Those vehicles are very similar to the agents in the simulator. \n",
    "- A Braintenber Vehicle is equipped with two sensors that are activated according to the proximity of a source. With the agent, each proximeter sensor returns a value between 0 and 1 that is inversely proportional to the distance from the closest obstacle it perceives (the closer the obstacle, the highest to proximeter activation). Sensor values are accessed with `agent.sensors()`\n",
    "- A Braintenber Vehicle is equipped with two wheels. An agent in the simulator is also equipped with two whells, whose rotating speeds are controlled through the activation of each motor independently with a value between 0 and 1 (where 1 means maximum speed). E.g. setting the left wheel at full speed is achieved with `agent.left_motor = 1`, while stopping the right wheel is achieved with `agent.right_motor = 0`.\n",
    "- A behavior associates sensor activations to motor activations. In the Braitenberg Vehicles, this is achieved through connections that are either excitatory (the activity of the sensor increases the activity of the motor it is connected to) or inhibitory (the activity of the sensor decreases the activity of the motor it is connected to). In the agent, we have seen above that we can define a behavior as a function that (1) read the sensor activities (2) perform some computation and (3) use the result of that computation to set the motor speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can implement in the agent the various types of vehicle behaviors shown in the slide, where defining excitatory and inhibitory connections will be done through Step (2) above (*perform some computation*). We have actually already done it with the `slow_down` behavior we have defined above.  "
